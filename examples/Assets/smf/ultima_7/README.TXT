  Allright, what is all this junk?
  These are MIDI files for the Roland MT-32 extracted from
  The Ultima7 soundtrack.  Specifically, from the file 
  MT32MUS.DAT.  Anyway, the MT32 maps is patches out of
  sync with the General Midi standard, so I went trough and
  rearranged all the patches and found out what's supposed to
  be where.  Then all the volumes were wrong, so I had to fix
  those too.  The volumes of each song are rather low, so you'll
  have to turn up the volume on your amp or stereo or whatever
  you have your sound card hooked to, but the patches are at the 
  right volumes in relation to one another.
  I specifically did this on, and for, the Ultrasound.  If you're
  using this card, you had better have the full GM patch set and
  will PROBABLY need more than the 256k of memory to get all the
  files to play.
    That's about it!  I'd be anxious to hear what you think of my
  work here, so drop me a line and let me know!
